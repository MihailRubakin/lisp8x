Lisp8x is a port of 8kLisp to the monochrome TI z80 calculators.
The Lisp is documented in 8kl.doc (not actually an MS word doc,just a text
file, but that's how it was named on CP/M 28 years ago). Most things are
working, besides most file I/O and there is no user interface at all. I am
hoping to implement these in the near-ish future. The input routine is taken
from Calcsys, so credit goes to the authors. Note that everything in lowercase
was added by me (the original source was very loud). The source can be compiled
with Brass.
