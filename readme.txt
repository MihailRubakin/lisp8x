Lisp8x is a port of 8kLisp to the monochrome TI z80 calculators.
The Lisp is documented in 8kl.doc (not actually an MS word doc,just a text
file, but that's how it was named on CP/M 28 years ago). Most things are
working, besides most file I/O and there is no user interface at all. I am
hoping to implement these in the near-ish future. Credit goes to Alexander
Berger, who wrote 8klisp originally. The input routine is taken from Calcsys,
so credit goes to the. Note that everything in lowercase was added by me 
(the original source was all-caps). The source can be assembled with Brass.
